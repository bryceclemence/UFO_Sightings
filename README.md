### Summary
One drawback of this database is that we are not able to input multiple search criteria on our website. If we are able to do this we would be able to see if events happened at
specific times and places and see if they are related in any way. While are database is not that big and this would be pretty straightforward to do now, if we obtained a larger 
set of data this would be extremely healful.
A recommendation I would have, would be to include any photographic or videa imaging, so that we could see the event for ourselves. This could also help to see if any events 
are somehow related to each other.
A second recommendation would be to add resources on other websites or informative areticles that captivated mind can look into and dive deeper into their understanding of 
extraterrestial events.
